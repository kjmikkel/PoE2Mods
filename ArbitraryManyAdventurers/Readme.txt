Arbitrary Many Adventurers - 1.0.0

:: REQUIREMENTS ::
* Deadfire at version 5.0.0.0040
* Unity Mod Manager: https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/21

:: FEATURES ::
In the base game you are only allowed to make up to 8 custom adventurers. If you want to try other builds with custom adventurers, you will need to permanently kill one of them. This mod allows you to bypass this restriction, build, recruit, and keep as many as you want. 

:: LIMITATIONS ::
This mod does not change the amount of party members you can have at any one time (for that see https://www.nexusmods.com/pillarsofeternity2/mods/288).
While I have tested up to 18 custom adventurers (and all companions and sidekicks), I honestly do not know what will happen if you recruit 50, 100 or 150.
It does not change the party manager screen, so you will still have to use the slider to find the person you want to recruit.
