Smarter Unpause - 1.0

:: REQUIREMENTS ::
• Deadfire at version 1.1.0.0035

• A version of the Patchwork modding framework for PoE2 which can be found here: https://github.com/SonicZentropy/PoE2Mods.pw/releases

Windows: .NET Framework 4.5+
Linux and Mac: Mono 4.2.1.102+

:: FEATURES ::

This mod makes the auto-pause smarter by having a grace period between the auto-pause happening, and accepting a manual unpause command. By default this value is 0,5 seconds, but you can set it to anything you like in the included config.ini file.

:: LIMITATIONS ::
Steam Achievements should be disabled by using this (but I am not sure), but you will still be able to earn Berath's Blessings points and GOG Achivements.

:: INSTALLATION ::
Unzip the file and stick it in the ...\Pillars of Eternity II Deadfire\ directory.
