Smarter Unpause - 1.0.0.1

:: REQUIREMENTS ::
• Deadfire at version 3.0.0.0021
• A version of the Patchwork modding framework for PoE2 which can be found here: https://github.com/SonicZentropy/PoE2Mods.pw/releases

To run this you will need:
Windows: .NET Framework 4.5+  
Linux and Mac: Mono 4.2.1.102+

:: FEATURES ::
This mod makes the auto-pause smarter by having a grace period between the auto-pause happening, and accepting a manual unpause command. By default this value is 0,5 seconds, but you can set it to anything you like in the included config.ini file.

:: LIMITATIONS ::
Steam Achievements might be disabled by using this (but I am not sure), but you will still be able to earn Berath's Blessings points and GOG achievements.

:: INSTALLATION ::
Unzip the Mods folder and put it in the ...\Pillars of Eternity II Deadfire\ directory.
