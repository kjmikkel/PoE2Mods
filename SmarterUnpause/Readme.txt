Smarter Unpause - 1.0.0.6

:: REQUIREMENTS ::
• GOG version at 3.1.1.0024 and Steam at 3.1.1.0023
• A version of the Patchwork modding framework for PoE2 which can be found here: https://www.nexusmods.com/pillarsofeternity2/mods/231

To run this you will need:
Windows: .NET Framework 4.5+  
Linux and Mac: Mono 4.2.1.102+

:: FEATURES ::
This mod makes the auto-pause smarter by having a grace period between the auto-pause happening, and accepting a manual unpause command. By default this value is 0,5 seconds, but you can set it to anything you like in the included config.ini file.

:: LIMITATIONS ::
Steam Achievements might be disabled by using this (but I am not sure), but you will still be able to earn Berath's Blessings points and GOG achievements.

Unzip the Mods folder and put it in the 
...\Pillars of Eternity II Deadfire\ directory for the GOG version
