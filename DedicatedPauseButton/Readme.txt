Dedicated Pause Button - 1.0.0

:: REQUIREMENTS ::
* Deadfire at version 5.0.0.0040
* Unity Mod Manager: https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/21

:: FEATURES ::
This mods allows you to set a key binding that will pause the game, but not toggle it unpaused if you push it again. It should be noted that if the key binding you are using is already in use, both the pausing and its current key mapping will hapen at the same time. For instance if you bind it to "A" button, the game will pause and the camera will drift left.
The pause button is initially set to nothing, so you will have to figure out what key binding works for you, and set it in options.
