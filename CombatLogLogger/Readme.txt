Combat Log Logger - 1.0

:: REQUIREMENTS ::
• Deadfire at version 1.1.0.0035

• A version of the Patchwork modding framework for PoE2 which can be found here: https://github.com/SonicZentropy/PoE2Mods.pw/releases

Windows: .NET Framework 4.5+
Linux and Mac: Mono 4.2.1.102+

:: FEATURES ::

This mod saves the combat log so you can read it later. In the config file you can configure where it is saved, whether auto-pause messages should be included, and an option to include other keywords that should exclude a combat message line

:: LIMITATIONS ::
Steam Achievements should be disabled by using this (but I am not sure), but you will still be able to earn Berath's Blessings points and GOG Achivements.

:: INSTALATION ::
Unzip the file and stick it in the ...\Pillars of Eternity II Deadfire\ directory.
