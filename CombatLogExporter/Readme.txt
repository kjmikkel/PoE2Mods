Combat Log Exporter - 1.5

:: REQUIREMENTS ::
• Deadfire at version 3.0.0.0021
• A version of the Patchwork modding framework for PoE2 which can be found here: https://github.com/SonicZentropy/PoE2Mods.pw/releases

To run this you will need:
Windows: .NET Framework 4.5+  
Linux and Mac: Mono 4.2.1.102+

:: FEATURES ::
This mod saves the combat log so you can read it later. In the config file you can configure where it is saved, whether tooltip information should be saved, whether auto-pause messages should be included, and an option to include other keywords that should exclude a combat message line

:: LIMITATIONS ::
Steam Achievements might be disabled by using this (but I am not sure), but you will still be able to earn Berath's Blessings points and GOG achievements.

:: INSTALLATION ::
Unzip the Mods folder and put it in the ...\Pillars of Eternity II Deadfire\ directory.
   
:: RUN INSTRUCTIONS ::
Run the Patchwork program and set the base Deadfire directory (this is one time only), Click "Active Mods" button, click the "Add" button and go the Mods folder and select the CombatLogExporter.pw.dll file, click the "Close" button and then push the "Launch with Mods" button - enjoy :)
